I think I figured out the update for youtube sources, though I may need to play with timing because the test alerts are sometimes popping up twice
when navigating.
This weekend I also experimented with Amazon Honeycode which allows you to make "codeless" web/mobile apps during the CSE Amazon hackathon.
Instead of code like javascript or python you use a display editor like android studio has for the layout  and Lambda like you would use in Excel. 
I do not recommend using it. 
It only supports 20 free users and the only way to deal with user permissions is by making separate apps for different permission levels.
The users also have to log into what are essentially developer accounts to even use the apps.

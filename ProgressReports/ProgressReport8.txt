I almost have the extension where I want it.
I changed the alert to a confirmation window so it can open a link.
I tried to get it to to read the channel names, 
but it seems to require a bit more than just a getElementById
so the window just opens socialblade in a new window.
I also renamed the extension to Social extension.

I have created a new git repository for this class.
I have installed node.js and the required packages.
I used Django for my 4050 project so I figured that getting experience with the more traditional node.js development would be a good idea.
I haven't quite decided what I want to do for the project, but I am leaning towards a social media statistics monitor that will also link to an android app and possibly a chrome extension.
